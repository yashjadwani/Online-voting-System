# Online-voting-System
This is a project regarding voting system.

In this I have used MySQl datatabse(you can download it from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/).
Make sure you through any website for connecting python with MySQL.
In workbench create the Databse name Project with Username: "root" and password:"root".
This project uses 2 Tables "voter" and "Vote".
